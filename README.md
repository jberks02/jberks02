- Hi, I’m @jberks02
- I’m interested in embedded development, machine learning/AI, and robotics
- I’m currently learning embedded development in order to take my first steps into c++ and c programming
- I'm a full stack web developer, including mobile, with years of experience.

My goal is to further my knoweledge in all computing fields. Which is why I have interests in embedded programming.
